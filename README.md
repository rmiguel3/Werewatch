# WereWatch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Why this was made?

I created this as a personal project to help me decide on what movie to watch. I always have issues with going through the streaming services I use to find something to watch only to then spend more time finding a movie and then not watching. 

Starts out as picking out which streaming services you use and then provides a list of movies available and broken down by genres, trends, and other stuff.

# Misc
I will be updating this as I progress through the project
